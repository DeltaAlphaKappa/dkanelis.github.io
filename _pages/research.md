> Accounting is not only about Debits and Credits

My research focuses on financial communication and the perceptions of capital market participants. To this end, I use machine learning methods and natural language processing tools to harvest novel data from corporate disclosures and other sources (e.g., social media and news outlets).

### Context matters: The role of fair value footnote narratives
With [Argyro Panaretou](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/people/argyro-panaretou) and [Catherine Shakespeare](https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/cathy-shakespeare)
### Abstract

To reduce uncertainty regarding the fair value measurement process, financial statements come with explanatory footnotes, the relevance and informativeness of which has been challenged by financial statement users and practitioners. In this paper we investigate whether the narrative components of fair value footnotes affect investor uncertainty. Our results suggest that, incrementally to the volume of tabulated fair value footnote disclosures, fair value narratives can assist financial statement users in understanding the reliability of opaque fair value estimates. We document a negative association between the length of fair value narratives and investor uncertainty towards Level 3 fair value asset estimates. However, further tests reveal that fair value narratives can also result in increased investor uncertainty, when they are boilerplate. Collectively, our findings shed new light on the role of narrative information in the fair value footnotes and inform standard setters, managers, and academics researching fair value reporting.

### Tightening rating standards: The effect of narrative risk disclosures
With [Argyro Panaretou](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/people/argyro-panaretou) and [Grzegorz Pawlina](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/people/grzegorz-pawlina)
### Abstract

Credit rating agencies harvest and analyze debt issuer information to produce credit ratings, which are numerical assessments of the overall creditworthiness of firms, and are integral for the smooth functioning of debt markets. Research findings show that credit rating agencies are becoming stricter over time; assigning ratings that are worse than what the fundamentals of debt issuers can justify. The reasons behind this tightening of rating standards are largely unexplored. We examine whether narrative disclosure information, which has been increasing over time, mediates this phenomenon. Our findings suggest that risk-related narrative disclosures can mediate the tightening of rating standards. Further tests reveal that this mediating effect is more pronounced when debt issuers’ disclosures possess textual attributes that can facilitate the reader’s understanding of firm risk.
