> Accounting is not only about Debits and Credits

My research focuses on financial communication and the perceptions of capital market participants. To this end, I use machine learning methods and natural language processing tools to harvest and process novel data from corporate disclosures and other sources (e.g., social media and news outlets).

### Context matters: The role of fair value footnote narratives
With [Argyro Panaretou](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/people/argyro-panaretou) and [Catherine Shakespeare](https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/cathy-shakespeare)
### Abstract

To increase the transparency of their fair value estimates, firms provide additional information in the notes to the financial statements, the quality of which has been challenged by financial statement users. We examine whether the narrative components of fair value footnotes, which should help users contextualise quantitative fair value information, affect investor uncertainty. Our results suggest that, incrementally to the volume of tabulated fair value footnote disclosures, fair value narratives can help investors to understand the measurement process of opaque fair value estimates, and assess their reliability. However, they can also increase investor uncertainty when boilerplate. Our findings shed new light on the communicative role of narrative information in the fair value footnotes, and inform accounting standard setters and financial statement preparers on how fair value measurement can become more understandable to investors.

### Tightening rating standards: The effect of narrative risk-related
disclosures
With [Argyro Panaretou](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/people/argyro-panaretou) and [Grzegorz Pawlina](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/people/grzegorz-pawlina)
### Abstract

Research findings show that credit rating agencies are becoming stricter over time; assigning ratings that are worse than what the fundamentals of debt issuers can justify. The reasons behind this tightening of rating standards are largely unexplored. We examine whether narrative disclosure information, which has been increasing over time, mediates this phenomenon. Our findings suggest that risk-related narrative disclosures can mediate the tightening of rating standards. Further tests reveal that this mediating effect is more pronounced when debt issuers’ disclosures possess textual attributes that can facilitate the reader’s understanding of firm risk. The paper’s findings add new evidence to the limited research on the reasons behind rating stringency, and suggest that academics and practitioners should also consider soft information (e.g., narrative disclosures) when evaluating corporate credit ratings.

**Keywords**: Credit ratings; Rating stringency, Narrative disclosures; Risk; Uncertainty.

### Do firms manage their disclosure behaviour to demonstrate their potential? Evidence from credit watch placements
 
### Abstract

Credit watch placements signal uncertainty about a firm’s future creditworthiness and are accompanied by increased demand for information. I examine how credit watch placements affect the disclosure behaviour, and reporting complexity of rated firms. Results suggest that firms alter their disclosure behaviour, and reduce their reporting complexity when placed under a negative credit watch. However, I document no such finding for positive credit watch placements. This result is consistent with firms being more concerned about the risks associated with a potential credit rating downgrade. The paper’s findings add new insights into the disciplining role of credit rating agencies, and financial communication under uncertainty.

**Keywords**: Credit rating agencies; Credit watches, Reporting complexity; Uncertainty.
