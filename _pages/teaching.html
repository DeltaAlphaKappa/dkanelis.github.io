Teaching and research are not ‘zero-sum’.

I have been teaching at Lancaster University since the first year of my PhD, and have been involved in Accounting (and Finance) undergraduate and postgraduate modules. I am also an Associate Fellow of the HEA, from [Advance HE](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk) - the national body for teaching in Higher Education in the UK.
