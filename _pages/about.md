Welcome to my website

I am an Assistant Professor in Financial Accounting at [Maastricht School of Business and Economics](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/department-accounting-and-information-management-aim). 

Before joining academia, I worked as an executive compensation and governance analyst for [Willis Towers Watson](https://www.wtwco.com/en-GB/Solutions/executive-compensation). In 2022, I was a visiting scholar at the [University of Michigan, Ross School of Business](https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/areas-of-study/accounting).

My research focuses on financial reporting, information uncertainty, narrative disclosures, and fair value accounting. To this end, I use machine learning methods and natural language processing tools to harvest and process novel data from corporate disclosures and other sources (e.g., social media and news outlets). I am also interested in the interplay of soft and hard financial (and non-financial) information, and cross-discipline accounting research.
