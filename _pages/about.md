Welcome to my website. 

I am a PhD Candidate in Accounting at [Lancaster University Management School](https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/people/dimitrios-kanelis(e1651f58-d73a-4104-b5b9-6a3cd51817ff).htm](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/our-departments/accounting-and-finance/research/) (LUMS). Before joining academia, I worked as an executive compensation and governance analyst for Willis Towers Watson. In 2022, I was a visiting scholar at the [University of Michigan, Ross School of Business](https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/areas-of-study/accounting).

My research interests include financial communication, information uncertainty, natural language processing, and fair value reporting. I am also interested in interdisciplinary accounting research.
