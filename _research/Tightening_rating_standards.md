excerpt: 'Credit rating agencies harvest and analyze debt issuer information to produce credit ratings, which are numerical assessments of the overall creditworthiness of firms, and are integral for the smooth functioning of debt markets. Research findings show that credit rating agencies are becoming stricter over time; assigning ratings that are worse than what the fundamentals of debt issuers can justify. The reasons behind this tightening of rating standards are largely unexplored. We examine whether narrative disclosure information, which has been increasing over time, mediates this phenomenon. Our findings suggest that risk-related narrative disclosures can mediate the tightening of rating standards. Further tests reveal that this mediating effect is more pronounced when debt issuers’ disclosures possess textual attributes that can facilitate the reader’s understanding of firm risk.'

### Abstract

Credit rating agencies harvest and analyze debt issuer information to produce credit ratings, which are numerical assessments of the overall creditworthiness of firms, and are integral for the smooth functioning of debt markets. Research findings show that credit rating agencies are becoming stricter over time; assigning ratings that are worse than what the fundamentals of debt issuers can justify. The reasons behind this tightening of rating standards are largely unexplored. We examine whether narrative disclosure information, which has been increasing over time, mediates this phenomenon. Our findings suggest that risk-related narrative disclosures can mediate the tightening of rating standards. Further tests reveal that this mediating effect is more pronounced when debt issuers’ disclosures possess textual attributes that can facilitate the reader’s understanding of firm risk.

**Keywords**: Credit ratings; Rating stringency, Narrative disclosures; Risk; Uncertainty.
